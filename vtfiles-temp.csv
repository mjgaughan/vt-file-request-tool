There are three major types of audits for which we are responsible.

Performance audits, the State’s financial statement audit (ACFR) and the State’s single audit (which looks at the usage of federal funds by the state). All of these audits focus on the accountability of the State to its citizens, from both a financial and service delivery perspective. I’m particularly proud that we’ve successfully implemented performance auditing in our office because these audits provide valuable insight into whether government programs and operations are working effectively and efficiently and provide recommendations for improvements. I invite you to email suggestions for future performance audits.

How we perform our audits.

We perform our audits in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards, which are promulgated by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Implementation of these standards ensures that our audit work and products are of the highest quality and uphold the principles of independence, objectivity, competence, and integrity. If you are interested in the nuts and bolts of how we perform our work, I invite you to peruse our Professional Standards Manual. Of course, the most important element in ensuring that our audits are conducted in a quality manner is our staff. Currently, we are an office of 15, which includes ten staff auditors, many of whom have achieved prestigious certifications, such as Certified Public Accountant (CPA), and advanced academic degrees.

The results of our work.

A quick synopsis can be found in our annual performance report. The most visible results are in the implementation of our recommendations. As you'll see in our annual performance report, the most recent follow-up work on our recommendations showed that more than two-thirds had been implemented. As a result, the state has saved money, employed additional safeguards against fraud, waste and abuse, and improved its processes and procedures.

If you have any questions or concerns to bring to my attention, please feel free to call or write me at any time."

Department of Vermont Healthcare Access,Kelly Provost,AHS.DVHALegal@Vermont.gov,NA,NA,"[rural hospitals, healthcare access, state health insurance, medicaid provider]","When we say our mission is ""to improve the health and well-being of Vermonters by providing access to quality healthcare cost effectively,"" we are really saying that we are striving to do multiple things. First, we are saying what we're trying to do: to improve the health and well-being of Vermonters. Second, we're saying how we're trying to do it: by providing access to quality healthcare. But that's not all. We’re committing to do so cost-effectively. In other words, we are conscious that we are accountable to both our members and to taxpayers.

To achieve this mission, our work revolves around three core responsibilities:

1) We engage Vermonters in need to enroll as members in appropriate programs. This work is represented by the ""Vermonters"" path in the diagram above.

2) We pay for their care. This work of building, and collaborating with, a robust network of health care providers, pharmacies, and other partners is represented in the ""Providers"" path above.

3) We recognize that simply signing up thousands of people and paying thousands of invoices will not achieve optimal outcomes at the most efficient cost, so we strategically invest in programs that promote health. This work is central to our commitment to quality and improvement.

Our Priorities
Our commitment to continual improvement is not limited to external health outcomes. When we look for opportunities to improve internally – in the way we carry out our responsibilities – three priorities emerge: adoption of value-based payments, management of information technology projects, and operational performance improvement. If we successfully execute these priorities, we will be well positioned to deliver on the triple aim of improving patient experience of care, improving population health, and reducing per capita cost growth.

Our department is comprised of 20 functional units, every one of which works on one or more of our responsibilities and contributes to one or more of our priorities.

Our Values
Our department commits to executing our responsibilities and priorities while adhering to three core values:

1) Transparency – We trust that we will achieve our collective goals most efficiently if we communicate the good, the bad, and the ugly with our partners and stakeholders.

2) Integrity – In the words of psychologist Brené Brown, we commit to ""choosing courage over comfort…. choosing what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy…. choosing to practice [our] values rather than simply professing them.""

3) Service – Everything we do is funded by taxpayers to serve Vermonters. Therefore, we must ensure that our processes and policies are person-centered. We aim to model, drive, and support the integration of person-centered principles throughout our organizational culture.

These values guide our pursuit of the above responsibilities, priorities, and mission. We are committed to innovation and collaboration. We are not tied to any one way of carrying out our charges. We approach opportunities to manage Medicaid costs differently with an open mind and a commitment to do right by Medicaid members and Vermont taxpayers. We recognize that the success of our initiatives is dependent on strong working relationships with other state agencies, federal and local governments, and community partners."

Vermont Housing and Conservation Board,NA,info@vhcb.org,NA,NA,"[nonprofit housing, development, affordable housing, public lands,]","Established in 1987, the Vermont Housing & Conservation Board remains the forerunner in the nation in pioneering a comprehensive approach to affordable housing and community development linked with land conservation and historic preservation. The results have been impressive. With a cadre of nonprofit organizations working at the local level to identify and develop important projects in each community, the effects of more than 30 years of investment are discernible in every part of the state. VHCB has supported reinvestment in older housing in town and village centers, revitalizing downtown neighborhoods where residents can walk to services, and rebuilding a sense of community while spurring other private investment. The conservation of Vermont’s open and wild lands preserves the landscape that is such an integral part of the state’s identity, supports the agricultural and forest economies, protects wildlife habitat, and provides public access to the state’s waterways and woodlands.

Impact
Since its inception, the Board has awarded $370 million to nonprofit housing and conservation organizations, towns, municipalities and state agencies to conserve land, develop housing and restore historic community buildings in more than 200 towns. This investment has directly leveraged approximately $1.7 billion from other private and public sources and resulted in the creation of more than 13,420 affordable homes, the conservation of 437,000 acres of agricultural and recreational lands, forestland and natural areas, and the restoration of 74 historic community buildings for public use. Many VHCB housing awards have supported housing in buildings eligible, nominated or listed on the State or National Register of Historic Places. Historic barns and farmhouses and archeological sites are located on many farms conserved with VHCB funding.

Addressing Challenges with Creative Solutions
Breaking down traditional silos of housing, economic development, and conservation, VHCB helps Vermonters tackle issues of chronic poverty, job losses, affordability, and fraying infrastructure. With our partners we provide affordable homes for working families, improve community infrastructure, invest in natural, recreational and historic assets, grow farm and forest businesses, and support energy efficiency and renewable energy generation. The economy of our rural state is becoming more resilient and the quality of life is improving as state agencies, nonprofit organizations, and the private sector work together to develop coordinated solutions to complex issues.

Over time, strategic VHCB investments have improved the economic stability of Vermont communities and downtowns, municipal and non-profit delivery systems, working lands, and Main Street businesses. In meeting multiple economic, environmental, and community objectives, VHCB supports housing, conservation, and community development projects that leverage private and federal funds, contribute to healthy communities and landscapes, promote smart growth, and support economic vitality."

Vermont Labor Relations Board,Judith Dillon,judith.dillon@vermont.gov,NA,NA,"[unions, collective bargianing, units, labor, union elections, unfair practices,]","Structure
The Board consists of six part-time members. A panel of three Board members generally hears and decides each case which goes to a hearing. The Board has two employees - Executive Director and Clerk.

Procedures
Unit Determinations and Representation Elections
Upon the filing of a petition for election of collective bargaining representative or a unit clarification petition, Board staff intervene actively with the parties to seek to resolve any unit determination issues in dispute. Unit disputes are informally resolved in many instances; if unit issues are not informally resolved, then a panel of three Board members will decide the matter after a hearing and filing of briefs. In cases where petitions for election or decertification of a collective bargaining representative are filed, once unit issues are resolved, Board staff conduct representation elections, usually at the involved workplace.

Unfair Labor Practices
Upon filing of unfair labor practice charges, the Board will seek an informal response from the employer or union against whom the charge was filed. Board staff then may meet with the parties to investigate the charge and explore the informal resolution of it. In some cases, the Board will not conduct an investigation beyond the pleadings, and will decide whether to issue a complaint based on the pleadings. If a complaint is issued, an evidentiary hearing governed by the Rules of Evidence is conducted by a three member panel of the Board. After providing the parties with an opportunity to file briefs, the Board issues a written decision.

Grievances
Grievances under the State Employees Labor Relations Act comprise a substantial part of the caseload of the Board, approximately half of its cases. Once a grievance is filed and the employer has filed an answer to it, Board staff often meet with the parties in informal status conferences or pre-hearing conferences to explore informal settlement of the grievance, discuss discovery issues, clarify issues, and/or seek to narrow the issues. If a grievance is not informally resolved and is not otherwise dismissed pursuant to a motion, the grievance is heard by a three member panel of the Board. Grievance hearings are more informal than unfair labor practice hearings in that they are not governed by the Rules of Evidence. The parties are provided with an opportunity to file post-hearing briefs. The Board then deliberates, and issues a written decision.

Appeal and Enforcement of Board Decisions
Board decisions generally may be appealed directly to the Vermont Supreme Court on questions of law. The Board decides whether its decisions should be stayed pending appeal, and that stay decision also may be appealed to the Supreme Court. Board decisions are enforceable by a party or the Board in superior court.

Publications and Educational Services
The Board has Rules of Practice specific to each of the labor relations acts which it administers. The Board publishes volumes of decisions every one or two years, and now has published volumes covering the years 1977 through 2020. The Board also publishes a Guide to Vermont Labor Relations Statutes, the purpose of which is to keep practitioners before the Board fully aware of case law precedents. The Guide is updated annually, and contains: 1) copies of Vermont labor relations statutes, 2) a cumulative subject index of all Board decisions since 1977, 3) a cumulative alphabetical index of all Board decisions since 1977, 4) a cumulative subject index of Vermont Supreme Court public sector labor relations decisions, 5) a digest of all Vermont Supreme Court decisions on appeals of Board decisions and 6) the Board Rules of Practice.  Further, the Board has issued the fifth edition of a book on Vermont labor relations law entitled The Evolving Vermont Labor Relations Law.

In addition to these publications, the Board conducts labor relations conferences and training sessions. The Board is an active member of the Association of Labor Relations Agencies and the New England Consortium of State Labor Relations Agencies."

The Public Utility Commission is a three-member, quasi-judicial commission that supervises the rates, quality of service, and overall financial management of Vermont's utilities: electric, natural gas, telecommunications, and private water companies. The Commission also supervises cable television companies, although federal law preempts most authority to regulate cable rates or programming. The Commission also reviews the environmental and economic impacts of proposals to purchase energy supply or build new energy facilities; monitors the safety of hydroelectric dams; evaluates the financial aspects of nuclear plant decommissioning and radioactive waste storage; reviews rates paid to independent power producers; and oversees the statewide Energy Efficiency Utility programs."
Vermont State Treasurer,Ashlynn Doyon,treasurers.office@vermont.gov,NA,NA,"[treasurer, money, budget, municipal retirement, public retirement, teacher pension, public employee pension, retirement, unclaimed property ]","Beth Pearce is Vermont's 30th State Treasurer.  She became State Treasurer in 2011 and has been elected to three terms. Treasurer Pearce has over 40 years of experience in government finance at both the state and local levels.

The State Treasurer's Office is responsible for a wide range of administrative and service duties:

Investment of State funds.
Issuing all State bonds authorized by the General Assembly.
Serving as the central bank for State agencies.
Management of the State’s cash balances, processing of checks, and the reconciliation of payroll and vendor checks.
Safeguarding and return of unclaimed or abandoned financial property, which is held in trust by the State until the rightful owner can be located.
Administration of three major pension plans, the deferred compensation plan, and the defined contribution plan for State employees, teachers, and participating municipalities.
The State Treasurer’s Office takes these responsibilities seriously, managing the resources within its purview effectively and efficiently and promoting prudent financial practices in the State of Vermont. 

Organization
The State Treasurer’s Office is organized into an executive office and five divisions. The executive office is responsible for overall strategic planning, legislative initiatives, constituent relations, debt management, financial literacy, and supervision of the divisions. The Treasury Operations Division is responsible for the State’s banking, cash management, and financial transaction services. The Retirement Division administers three public retirement systems authorized by the legislature. Investment and Debt Management Services provides investment services for the State of Vermont and the three pension systems administered by the office, as well as debt management. The Unclaimed Property Division serves as the caretaker of abandoned or unclaimed financial property, while seeking to return it to its proper owner. Technology Services is responsible for developing and maintaining automated systems, providing appropriate access to information, maintaining the office web site, and maintaining the overall security of the office network and automated interactions with other State departments and entities outside of State government. 

Treasury Operations 
The Treasury Operations Division is the core operation for money movement within the State. The division is responsible for the banking, cash management, and short-term investing of State funds; the establishment and maintenance of the State’s banking network; the disbursement of the State’s warranted payments and debt service; the collection of certain receipts, including those related to education property tax payments from municipalities; and the recording of accounting transactions. Specific functions include:

The division directs the statewide cash management activities, with annual receipts and disbursements in excess of $5 billion. Activities include oversight of the State’s cash balances, preparing cash projections, processing automated and manual checks and electronic fund transfers, and reconciling the State’s core bank accounts. The division ( in conjunction with agencies and departments, and  financial institution partners) is responsible for implementing an effective and efficient statewide banking network to provide state-of-the-art cash management services and to ensure that the highest-quality services are available to customers.
The division invests and reinvests cash balances in a manner consistent with the safety and liquidity requirements for these funds, and that maximizes the earnings on temporary funds in accordance with statute.
The division processes approximately 1.5 million payments each year. More than two-thirds of those are conducted electronically, and one of the division's goals is to increase the proportion of transactions that occur electronically.
The division is responsible for preparing financial statements and schedules for the annual audit of the State’s books (as it relates to cash and investment disclosures), administering the Municipal Equipment Loan Fund, and assisting the Retirement Operations Division staff in the preparation of the pension trust fund financial statements.
This division also monitors education tax receipts from municipalities. If a municipality were delinquent in its education tax payment, the division would work to obtain proper payment. Unresolved delinquencies in payments could be referred to the Attorney General's Office for collection and/or prosecution.  
Retirement Operations 
The primary function of the Retirement Operations staff is to serve the needs of the active contributing members and retired members receiving benefit payments.

The State administers three defined benefit public retirement systems authorized by the legislature. These systems provide plans for State employees, public school teachers (grades K - 12), and municipal employees. Each retirement system has a governing board of trustees, with day-to-day administration provided by the Retirement Operations Division. Approximately 45,000 people are covered by these retirement systems.
The division provides administrative support for an optional defined contribution plan for exempt State employees. The Treasurer is the sole trustee for the fund and provides an array of investment options through a third party administrator, Fidelity Investments. The Municipal Retirement Board also provides oversight to an optional defined contribution plan.
The Retirement Division also administers a deferred compensation (457) program, a 403(b) investment program for school districts throughout the state, and a single depository investment account (SDIA)--a tax-sheltered account funded through employee transfers to a non-contributory system for State employees and teachers.
Services include member enrollment, provision of pension and health benefits information, retirement counseling and planning for members and retirees, collection and accounting for member and employer contributions, and financial management services for plan assets. 
Investment and Debt Management Services 
The Treasurer’s Office provides long-term investment services for the State of Vermont and the three pension systems. In addition, staff assists the Treasurer in the management of debt,  providing central coordination for all state-issued debt. Vermont’s disciplined approach to bonding and debt management in recent years resulted in Vermont rejoining the ranks of triple-A-rated states in February of 2007.

Certain trusts, including the Higher Education Fund, Tobacco Trust Fund, a State OPEB Trust Fund, and other trusts are pooled and invested in a Trust Investment Account (TIA). The Trustee for these funds is the State Treasurer. The Director of Investment and Debt Management assists the Treasurer in managing these assets, including asset allocation, manager selection, due diligence, and portfolio review.
The retirement boards act as trustees for various benefit-related trusts, including the municipal defined contribution plan, SDIA fund, the 457 deferred compensation fund, and a Municipal Employees’ Health Benefit Fund. The Treasurer is also the sole trustee for a State employee defined contribution plan. All employ outside managers. The Director of Investment and Debt management and other staff provide due diligence and portfolio review, as well as contract compliance and reconciliation functions.
The Vermont Pension Investment Committee (VPIC) acts as the trustee for the defined benefit plan investments. The State Treasurer’s Office provides administrative support including portfolio rebalancing, review, and due diligence and works with VPIC’s independent consultant to assist the VPIC members in their fiduciary responsibility. That includes development of investment policies and objectives; risk management assessment; asset allocation; investment manager searches; performance measurement; and ongoing due diligence.
The State Treasurer’s Office is responsible for issuing and managing the State's debt in a prudent and cost effective manner, issues bonds to finance capital projects, and manages the State’s debt program. Specific responsibilities include:
Oversee and manage the issuance of State debt.
Manage relationships with business partners including the financial advisor, underwriters, investment bankers, and bond counsel.
Monitor and execute refunding opportunities.
Provide debt financing and advisory services to State agencies, authorities, boards, commissions, and higher education institutions.
Manage and monitor arbitrage compliance, post issuance compliance, and the State’s continuing disclosure. 
Unclaimed Property
The Unclaimed Property Division’s primary goal is to reunite individuals with their unclaimed financial property. Unclaimed property is cash, stocks, bonds, security deposits, and other property that is not real estate. Banks, insurance companies, and other businesses have been holding this property for the owner, but have since lost contact with the owner. State law requires that this property be turned over to the Unclaimed Property Division, which then attempts to locate the owners and return the property to them.

The division employs a variety of programs to reach potential owners of property, including publication of an annual list of names in daily newspapers, advertising campaigns; staffing a booth at fairs and expositions; distribution of lists to town clerks and legislators; and the maintenance of a web site with search capabilities. The division promptly processes claims to return property to its rightful owners.
Vermont’s unclaimed property statute requires entities, known as holders, to report and remit certain tangible and intangible property to the State when the owner of such property cannot be located or contacted after a certain period of time. The division takes steps to ensure that holders of unclaimed financial property file their annual unclaimed property report so that these funds can reach their rightful owners. 
Technology Services 
The Technology Services Division is committed to providing excellent programming and technical support services to all the divisions of the Treasurer's Office. The intent is to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and security, and to contribute to the office's commitment to a high standard of service to the State of Vermont, its clients, and its citizens. The Technology Services Division is responsible for developing and maintaining automated systems, providing appropriate access to information, maintaining the Treasurer's Office web site, maintaining the office network and its security, and providing automated interaction with other departments and entities outside State government.

Constitutional Officers

Products from forests and farms enjoy global renown, as do our outdoor recreation opportunities, which are extremely popular and cater to individuals of all ages and skill levels. Thus it is not surprising that Vermont is one of the most desirable states to visit, live in, and conduct business.

Our forestland, natural resources, and outdoor recreation are a significant part of our identity. Forests comprise 78% of our landscape, providing habitat for many species of flora and fauna. Our forests, in fact, are a valuable, renewable, and thus sustainable resource, supporting an array of products, jobs, and recreational activities. Tourism and recreation, ever-more significant components of Vermont’s economy, are also directly dependent on our natural resources.

First Commissioner Perry MerrillVermont’s future, of course, will not only be shaped by in-state activities, but also by forces well beyond state lines: international markets, competing regional and national interests, climate change, diverse economies, and human demand for natural resources. In our state, where land is largely under private ownership and control, we—public and private sectors alike—must continue to work in partnership and engage in cooperative action to identify and work with these external forces for our collective, mutual benefit so that we create the Vermont we collectively want. We must also manage our natural resources within and not beyond our land’s natural capacity to produce them.

With oversight from the Vermont Legislature, the Vermont Agency of Transportation (VTrans) is responsible for planning, development, implementation, and maintenance of a variety of transportation infrastructure including, but not limited to, roads, bridges, state-owned railroads, airports, park and ride facilities, bicycle facilities, pedestrian paths, public transportation facilities and services, and Department of Motor Vehicles operations and motor carrier enforcement. VTrans serves the entire population of the State of Vermont.

VTrans has more than 1,200 employees organized in four divisions: Policy, Planning and Intermodal Development; Finance and Administration; Highway; and District Maintenance and Fleet. The Department of Motor Vehicles is also housed within the Agency of Transportation; it has a main office in Montpelier and ten satellite offices statewide.

VTrans interacts with all State agencies and agencies within the United States Department of Transportation, as well as other federal agencies, numerous regional and state governments, international jurisdictions and cross-border organizations, local governments, transit agencies, airports, railroads, and the other private and non-profit entities engaged in transportation-related activities.

AGENCY MISSION, VISION AND GOALS

The Highway Division of VTrans is organized into four bureaus: Construction & Materials, Operations & Safety, Project Delivery, and Asset Management. Together, the Highway bureaus provide data driven recommendations for investment or asset improvements; engineering design for transportation infrastructure, acquisition of real estate property and minimizing resources impacts for transportation projects; oversight for construction projects; ensure of the quality of materials; provide grants and technical support for municipal projects; provide information to the traveling public on road conditions; and inspect and maintain bridges, culverts, signs, and signals.

The Division of Policy, Planning and Intermodal Development (PPID) oversees major non-highway transportation modes including state-owned rail lines, nine stateowned airports, and public transit providers. In addition to providing statewide planning and policy support, the division works with Vermont’s eleven Regional Planning Commissions and, in the Burlington region, the Metropolitan Planning Organization to develop regional transportation plans and generate input on prioritizing transportation projects in the regions. The division’s work is also supported by public input from the Rail Advisory Council, Aviation Advisory Council, and the Public Transit Advisory Council. PPID also is the lead on research, mapping, development review, and public outreach.

The Division of Finance and Administration provides services across the agency to support the activities that deliver on the mission of VTrans including contract administration, information technology, continuous improvement, accounting, budgeting, audit, civil rights, labor compliance, and recruitment. As in all aspects of our work, state and federal statutes provide the guidance and boundaries for Finance and Administration’s work. The transportation budget is composed of Federal, State, and Local funds. Federal fund sources come from the Federal Highway Administration, Federal Transit Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, Federal National Highway Safety Administration, and the Federal Aviation Administration. State funds are appropriated from the State Transportation Fund. The State Transportation revenues are derived primarily from three sources: the gas tax, the purchase and use tax, and Department of Motor Vehicle fees."

Vermont Comission on Women,Hannah Elle Lane,Hannah.lane@vermont.gov,NA,NA,"[women, sexism, equity, voting, ]","The Vermont Commission on Women (VCW) is an independent non-partisan state government commission.   We have a staff of 3 and are governed by 16 Commissioners and an Advisory Council of representatives of 27 organizations serving women and girls in Vermont.  The purpose of the VCW is to advance rights and opportunities for women and girls in Vermont.  In furtherance of that purpose, VCW:

*  conducts research and study of issues affecting the status of women in Vermont;

*  advises and consults with the executive and legislative branches of State government on policies affecting the status of women in Vermont;

*  educates and informs business, education, State and local governments, and the general public about the nature and scope of sex discrimination and other matters affecting the status of women in Vermont;

*  serves as a liaison and clearinghouse between government, private interest groups, and the general public concerned with services for women.

Women in Vermont still face inequities in earnings, employment, safety, leadership, and many other areas. Women in Vermont earn just 84% of what men in Vermont earn. They are more likely to live in poverty, more likely to be unable to meet their basic financial needs, and more likely to be single parents. Women in Vermont continue to experience disproportionate domestic and sexual violence, and are experiencing sexual harassment at rates estimated as high as 70-80%. Women are underrepresented at the highest levels of leadership in almost every arena in Vermont, often dramatically so. Just 8 out of the top 100 companies in Vermont have CEOs who are women; just one statewide elected official is a woman; and Vermont is the only state in the country that has never sent a woman to represent it in Congress.

The Vermont Commission on Women is the only entity in Vermont that expressly considers the broad implications of state policy and budget priorities for women as they impact all aspects of women’s lives. Many of our partner organizations consider distinct pieces of that puzzle, but no other organization is attempting to address that full picture. Without our work, the state would be missing any comprehensive and cohesive work that knits together varied interests and provides the missing voices for policy and program development.

We are the only clearinghouse for data and research specifically concerning women in Vermont, providing information to support the work of legislators, advocates, the media, business, and leadership development organizations. Without our work, there would be no ready source for the full range of information that we provide.

We are the only one-stop source for information and referral for thousands of Vermont women – particularly low-income, rural woman with limited access to resources and supports – who have exhausted other resources or whose needs are so complex they don’t know where to turn. Without our work, many Vermonters would have significantly more difficulty finding the help they need.

We create and distribute publications that are unique in Vermont, providing comprehensive information on women’s legal rights. Without our work, these publications would not exist, and Vermonters would not have the ready access to this information that we now provide.

BACKGROUND:  In 1962, President Kennedy challenged every state to create a “Governor’s Commission on the Status of Women.” These commissions would be charged with two tasks: “To encourage women to use their abilities, and to reduce discrimination against women.”  In response, on November 23, 1964, Vermont Governor Philip Hoff established the Governor’s Commission on the Status of Women by executive order. The order directed the Commission to conduct research about “how discrimination was occurring, how women’s roles were changing, documenting the needs of working women and their children, and supporting a more active role of women in the political life of the state.” VCW Meeting 2_18

We are now one of the oldest commissions in continuous operation in the United States, celebrating our 50th anniversary in 2014.  In 2002 we were put into Vermont statute and renamed the Vermont Commission on Women.  Our rich history of accomplishments reflects the evolution of the status of women in society and the hard work and dedication of hundreds of Vermonters, Commissioners, staff, Advisors and community partners.
