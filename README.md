## An Algorithmic Assist for Transparency: Locating Relevant State Agencies for Vermont File Requests
### Middlebury College, Computer Science CSCI 701 (Fall 2021)

### about

Our project provides a web application that—given an appropriate natural language query from the user—will identify the correct State of Vermont department for the user to request relevant public information from. We have implemented this using an instance of the Apache Solr search engine, a Spring Boot API framework, a simple AngularJS front end, as well as some near-term matching for demarcating federal or state jurisdiction.

# Building
### Requirements:
- Java 8
- wget
- Solr 8.1
- Spring Boot
- Apache OpenNLP

### Set-up:
- Clone Git Repository
TKTK

# Usage
Once running, navigate to the frontend interface. Query the searchbar for anything pertaining to file requests in Vermont. Use the returned information to file a file request to the right agency.

### limitations
Currently, this service is limited to the state of Vermont. There is also limited functionality in the demarcation between state and federal agencies.
