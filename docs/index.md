## An Algorithmic Assist for Transparency: Locating Relevant State Agencies for Vermont File Requests
### Middlebury College, Computer Science CSCI 701 (Fall 2020)

See the [help](help.md) for resources on writing your project website.

### About our project
Our project provides a web application that—given an appropriate natural language query from the user—will identify the correct State of Vermont department for the user to request public information from. In order to implement this, we will use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and a search engine working on an index of all State of Vermont agencies and their file request protocols.

See the README in our [project repository](https://github.com/philipclaude/project-website) for information on building and using our software.
